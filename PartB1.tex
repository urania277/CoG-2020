%Up to 2000 chars...

The nature of 85\% of the matter in the universe is unknown. I will enable the ATLAS experiment to record data for a broad program of searches for this \textit{dark matter}, expanding upon the innovative techniques that I have pioneered in my ERC Starting Grant DARKJETS. 
The searches I will perform using this unique dataset will provide complementary and valuable input to the dark matter community worldwide, in terms of both technological advancements in data taking and high-impact physics outputs.

\section*{Section A: Extended synopsis of the proposal} 

\medskip

The first years of data taking at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{LHC2008} at CERN yielded the discovery of a new fundamental particle, the Higgs boson~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau}. With this and other notable results, the LHC data confirmed the predictive power of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, the theory of fundamental particles and non-gravitational interactions. However, the amount of ordinary matter described by the SM is exceeded by a kind of unknown matter as determined by cosmological observations, called Dark Matter (DM)~\cite{Bertone:2016nfn}. 

%My big idea is to expand on successful searches for DM that I pioneered to look elsewhere because now it's the time to expand that program. 

Theoretical models that include a new particle accounting for the abundance of DM in the universe include DM particles that can be produced at the LHC in collisions of ordinary matter (see e.g.~\cite{Boveia:2018yeb} and references therein). 
Creating DM in controlled conditions enables the study of its interactions with ordinary matter, complementing experiments capable of detecting cosmological DM  through direct and indirect methods. %~\cite{Boveia:2018yeb}. 

Dark matter searches have been a flagship of the physics programmes of LHC experiments, so far setting world-leading constraints on a number of theory models, and I have ensured that the complementarity of these results to direct constraints is highlighted~\cite{DMWG}. While it is worthwhile to keep pursuing these searches since current LHC datasets may not have reached the sensitivities required to probe the rarest SM-DM interactions, we need to significantly broaden our field of view in order to determine the particle nature of DM and its interactions~\cite{Bertone:2018xtm}. In this Consolidator Grant, I propose to do so for LHC searches in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item by making the most of the data recorded by the ATLAS experiment through innovative data-taking techniques, overcoming technological limitations that would otherwise force experiments to discard the majority of data of interest for many DM searches milliseconds after being taken;
	\item by leading searches of theoretically motivated DM models that until now have escaped being recorded and detected in this first phase of LHC data taking;
	\item by sharing derived analysis products, physics results and tools for their interpretation with the broader DM community in order to generate further impact by capitalising on the wealth of astroparticle and non-collider experiments planned to start taking data in this decade. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{[add a sentence saying what objectives make the reviewer go WOW. Why this is important and forward-looking.]}

As evidenced by my CV and track record, my profile combines both technical and scientific proficiency with leadership of large groups of scientists in both physics and data analysis tools. 
With my international collaborators and within my StG, I have led a paradigm shift in data taking techniques in ATLAS from software concept to publication \textbf{[and I am now HSF convenor]}. I have authored a number of LHC searches for DM and new phenomena, and I have coordinated ATLAS- and LHC-wide working groups instrumental to the design of DM search strategies~\cite{DMWG}. 
As an internationally recognised expert in the field, I have been invited to write review articles on the subject area of this proposal~\cite{Buchmueller:2017qhf, Boveia:2018yeb}, and have contributed to the European Strategy update, which defines the next 10 years of Europe-wide and international research in HEP, as one of the scientific secretaries of both the Dark Matter and Beyond the Standard Model Physics Planning Groups~\cite{Strategy:2019vxc}.

With a research team of two postdoctoral researchers and two students, complemented by talented Lund University undergraduates that I have a track record of recruiting and training, I am uniquely suited to deliver an ambitious research program that is timely, as it spans the entire upcoming LHC data taking period (Run-3). 

This is the ideal time to advance the state-of-the-art in DM searches and processing of large datasets, as the LHC schedule includes an initial commissioning period where innovations can be deployed and tested via early measurements with start-up data. The  second phase of this proposal will then use the wealth of data delivered by the LHC during its fully commissioned data taking period.

%In addition to further enhancing my standing as an expert in DM, 

As a recognized expert in DM searches and collider data taking techniques with a track record of synergistic interdisciplinary activities, the impact of this proposal will not be limited to high energy physics but will be disseminated further afield.
