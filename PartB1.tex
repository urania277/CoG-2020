%Up to 2000 chars...

The nature of 85\% of the matter in the universe is unknown. I will enable the ATLAS experiment to record data for a broad program of searches for this \textit{dark matter}, expanding upon the innovative techniques that I have pioneered in my ERC Starting Grant DARKJETS. 
The searches I will perform using this unique dataset will provide complementary and valuable input to the dark matter community worldwide, in terms of both technological advancements in data taking and high-impact physics outputs.

\section*{Section A: Extended synopsis of the proposal} 

\medskip

The first years of data taking at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{LHC2008} at CERN yielded the discovery of a new fundamental particle, the Higgs boson~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau}. With this and other notable results, the LHC data confirmed the predictive power of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, the theory of fundamental particles and non-gravitational interactions. However, the amount of ordinary matter described by the SM is exceeded by a kind of unknown matter as determined by cosmological observations, called Dark Matter (DM)~\cite{Bertone:2016nfn}. 

%My big idea is to expand on successful searches for DM that I pioneered to look elsewhere because now it's the time to expand that program. 

According to many theoretical models that include a new particle accounting for the abundance of DM in the universe, this new DM particle can be produced at the LHC in collisions of ordinary particles (see e.g.~\cite{Boveia:2018yeb} and references therein). 
Creating DM in controlled conditions enables the study of its interactions with ordinary particles, complementing experiments capable of detecting cosmological DM directly and indirectly. %~\cite{Boveia:2018yeb}. 

Dark matter searches have been a flagship of the physics programmes of LHC experiments, so far setting world-leading constraints on a number of theoretical hypotheses, and I have ensured that the complementarity of these results to direct constraints is highlighted~\cite{DMWG}. While it is worthwhile to keep pursuing these searches since the rare SM-DM interactions may not yet be accessible with the current LHC dataset, we need to significantly broaden our field of view in order to determine the particle nature of DM and its interactions~\cite{Bertone:2018xtm}. In this Consolidator Grant, I propose to do so for LHC searches in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item by making the most of LHC data recorded by the ATLAS experiment with innovative data-taking techniques, overcoming technological limitations that would otherwise force experiments to discard the majority of the data interesting for these searches milliseconds after being taken;
	\item by searching for more complex, less-explored yet theoretically motivated DM models that have escaped being recorded and detected in this first phase of LHC data taking;
	\item by connecting to the broader DM community that includes the wealth of astroparticle and non-collider experiments planned to start taking data in this decade, sharing physics results but also working together on tools for their interpretation, data processing, data analysis and open science. 
\end{itemize}
